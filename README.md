# Ash's pvp bot

A bot that im currently workin on yeah...

If you want to use my bot head over to src/ "cd src"

# And do `npm i` to install all packages 

then in the same src/ head over to package.json and find `scripts devStart` change the localhost to your server ip and the 1451 aka the port to your server port or whatever

# Current commnands
When the bot spawns do f!help and check in your console


# MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN SRC!!!
